2: Adding user:
   insert username and email after open your projet folder in cmd.
3: Git init:
   For applying git, type command in cmd
   //git init
4: Staging Area:
    Now we have to tell git, which files have to viewd and which were not.
   //git add [filename] : for adding single file to git.
      OR
   //git add -A : for adding all files inside folder
5: For checking which files are added:
   //git status
6: Snapshot:
   A feature that shows the snapshot of every single change, when update.
   Like a time machine you can go to your past. and fix errors of those files.
7: To share your project we used github, which provide space in server to upload
   your project and share it with others,
   Signup to githup.com and create a new Repository,
   Now upload your project inside this repository,
8: Now we used a command to upload your project using the link shown in your 
   repository:
   //git remote add origin linkofyourRepository
   example:
     git remote add origin https://github.com/Abdul-Wahid12345/firstProject.git
9: Now our project is linked to our github, now we have to pass data or upload data.
   //git push origin master
   it will ask you to enter email and password to upload data, once you enter 
   details, it will upload your files, now to check go to gihup repository and 
   refresh it.
10: now assume if another user on another pc want to clone your repository files 
   except of download, 
   1: he just have to create a folder in his pc.
   2: In cmd open his folder whic was created a sec ago.
   4: git clone repository link.//link of your repository.
11: // git pull origin master: to download the latest uploaded files by other users

12: Basic steps:
    git add filename     //for adding file
    git status           //for status
    git commit -m "i do those things"       //for snapshot, or description that what you changed.
    git pull origin master            //for uploading to your github  if origin is not added 
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Abdul-Wahid12345/firstProject.git    for adding your origin
